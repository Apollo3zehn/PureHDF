    H5_lookup3_mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.

    This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
    still in (a,b,c) after mix().

    If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
    mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
    are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
    This was tested for:
    * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
      of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
      (a,b,c).
    * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
      the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
      is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
      difference.
    * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
      all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.

    Some k values for my "a-=c; a^=rot(c,k); c+=b;" arrangement that
    satisfy this are
        4  6  8 16 19  4
        9 15  3 18 27 15
       14  9  3  7 17  3
    Well, "9 15 3 18 27 15" didn't quite get 32 bits diffing
    for "differ" defined as + with a one-bit base and a two-bit delta.  I
    used http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html to choose
    the operations, constants, and arrangements of the variables.

    This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
    that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
    most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
    avalanche in c.

    This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
    the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
    direction as the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
    seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands
    on, and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used
    rotates.

    H5_lookup3_final -- final mixing of 3 32-bit values (a,b,c) into c

    Pairs of (a,b,c) values differing in only a few bits will usually
    produce values of c that look totally different.  This was tested for
    * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
      of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
      (a,b,c).

    H5_checksum_lookup3() -- hash a variable-length key into a 32-bit value

      length  : the length of the key, counting by bytes
      initval : can be any 4-byte value
    Returns a 32-bit value.  Every bit of the key affects every bit of
    the return value.  Two keys differing by one or two bits will have
    totally different hash values.

    The best hash table sizes are powers of 2.  There is no need to do
    mod a prime (mod is sooo slow!).  If you need less than 32 bits,
    use a bitmask.  For example, if you need only 10 bits, do
      h = (h & hashmask(10));
    In which case, the hash table should have hashsize(10) elements.

    If you are hashing n strings (uint8_t **)k, do it like this:
      for (i=0, h=0; i<n; ++i) h = H5_checksum_lookup( k[i], len[i], h);
