# Unsupported Features

The following features are **not** (yet) supported:

- Filters
  - `N-bit`
  - `SZIP`
- Virtual datasets
  - with **unlimited dimensions**
- Data Types
  - Reference: `Attribute reference`, `object reference 2`, `dataset region reference 2` (I was unable to produce sample files using `h5py` or `HDF.PInvoke1.10` - the feature seems to be too new)
